# Star Wars Duel!
## Concept: 
In this game you play as either Luke Skywalker or Obi Wan Kenobi to face off against Darth Maul or Darth Vader. When your character and enemy have been chosen you click the attack button. The enemy will then attack back! If you are able to fully deplete his health you win! But if you are unable to before your health runs out you lose and the fate of the galaxy is doomed!
## Wireframes:
## Technologies Used:
    - HTML
    - CSS  
    - JavaScript
## Approach: 
I used what I learned from building the space batlle game as a foundation for this project. I incorporated the concepts from that excersise and what I have learned about DOM manipulation to create a simple game using basic javascript functions.
## Challenges: 
My biggest challenge was figuring out how to make the images in to buttons that the user could use to make their choices. After hours of googling and a lot of trial and error I was able to make it work!
## Additional information:
This is merely a school project using my favorite movie of all time and is in no way to be used for menetary purposes! All images used are copyright of lucasfilm and disney!!
